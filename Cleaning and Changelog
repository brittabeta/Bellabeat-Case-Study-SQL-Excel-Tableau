--ChangeLog and CleaningLog--
---Excel actions:
Sleep spreadsheet: Changed data type in sleep day column from datetime when all times listed as 12:00 AM to date format
Sleep spreadsheet: Added column for time in bed not sleeping by subtracting minutes sleeping from minutes in bed
Sleep spreadsheet: Checked for invalid data using MIN on in bed not sleeping minutes, output = 0, no sleep time exceeds time in bed
Sleep spreadsheets: MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE on all minute columns and number of sleep records column, all within a reasonable range of values
Activity spreadsheet: Changed data type in activity date column from datetime when all times listed as 12:00 AM to date format
Activity spreadsheet: used =COUNTIF(D:D,D2<>E2) on total distance and tracker distance columns, output 0, tracker distance a duplicate column, removed column
Activity spreadsheet: used =SUM on all distance subcategories then compared with total distance column using =COUNTIF(Q:Q,Q>0.1), output 0, subcategories valid
Activity spreadsheet: created total time column using =SUM on time subcategories, then using =MAX output 1440 minutes = 24 hours, =MIN output 2, not negative, subcategories valid
---BigQuery actions:
daily_activity dataset saved as activity
--Schema: all fields have appropriate type
--Unique ID inspection
---SELECT distinct Id FROM `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_v1` -> 33 unique Id’s in Id field
---SELECT CAST(Id AS STRING) AS Id FROM `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_v1` -> save as table activity_id as this does not need to be saved
---SELECT LENGTH(Id) FROM `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_id` -> all Id are 10 characters in length, length matches expected
--Check for duplicates
---SELECT (select count(1) from (select distinct * from `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_v1`)) as distinct_rows, (select count(1) from `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_v1`) as total_rows -> Row 1 distinct_rows 940 total_rows 940 = no duplicates
---Clean field TotalTime which includes SedentaryMinutes and LightlyActiveMinutes, remove SedentaryMinutes and LightlyActiveMinutes to coincide with exercise of at least “moderate intensity”
----SELECT Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, (VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes) AS TotalTime, LoggedActivitiesDistance, VeryActiveDistance, ModeratelyActiveDistance, LightActiveDistance, SedentaryActiveDistance, VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes, Calories   FROM `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_v1` -> Save table as activity
Sleep dataset in BigQuery
--Schema: all fields have appropriate type
--Unique ID inspection
---SELECT distinct Id FROM `case2-365021.sleep.sleep` -> 24 unique Id’s in Id field
---SELECT CAST(Id AS STRING) AS Id FROM `case2-365021.sleep.sleep` -> save as table sleep_id
---SELECT LENGTH(Id) FROM `case2-365021.sleep.sleep_id` -> all Id are 10 characters in length, length matches expected
--Check for duplicate 
---SELECT (select count(1) from (select distinct * from `case2-365021.sleep.sleep`)) as distinct_rows, (select count(1) from `case2-365021.sleep.sleep`) as total_rows -> Output: Row 1 distinct_rows 410 total_rows 413 = 3 duplicates
----Remove duplicates: SELECT distinct * from `case2-365021.sleep.sleep` -> Output: 410 distinct rows, save as table sleep_v2, delete sleep table, SELECT * FROM `case2-365021.sleep.sleep_v2` -> save as table sleep
Activity and Sleep datasets
--change Id columns to same data type
---SELECT CAST(Id AS STRING) AS Id FROM `case2-365021.sleep.sleep_id` -> save table as sleep_id_v2
--use INNER JOIN to show matching Id/users in both sleep and activity data
---SELECT activity.Id, sleep.Id FROM `case2-365021.daily_activity.activity_id` AS activity INNER JOIN `case2-365021.sleep.sleep_id_v2` AS sleep ON activity.Id = sleep.Id -> save BigQuery table as id_match under compare dataset
---query id_match to list the unique id matches and save table as id_match_v2
----SELECT DISTINCT Id, Id_1 FROM `case2-365021.compare.id_match` -> 24 users participated in both the sleep and activity use of the device
